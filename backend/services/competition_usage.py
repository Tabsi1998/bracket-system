"""Records which competition write path actually runs.

Before the classic store can be switched off, one question has to be answered
with numbers rather than with confidence: is anything still writing to it? The
codebase can show that a path *exists*; only measurement shows whether it is
*used*, and by which format.

Recording is deliberately best-effort. A failed measurement must never turn into
a failed tournament operation, so every error is swallowed - a missing data point
is acceptable, a broken result entry is not.
